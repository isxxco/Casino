Blackjack
A common casino game where you play against the dealer. The objective of the game is to get as close to 21 without going over. You'll have to research the card values, which are based on rank. As a hint, a ace can count as either a 1 or an 11 (whichever is more favorable to the player).

Each player (including the dealer) is initially dealt two cards. Both of the player's cards are face up, while only one of the dealer's cards is face up. Players have the option of hitting (asking the dealer for another card) or standing (accepting the current hand). It's not necessary that you implement more advanced options, such as doubling-down and splitting. However, you can earn extra credit points if you do so successfully.

A mandatory bet must be made before any cards are dealt (called an ante). If you choose to implement on hitting and standing, then no additional betting will take place. For those of you who wish to implement doubling-down and splitting, you'll need to account for additional bets.

When you double-down, you are allowed to increase your initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for standing after receiving exactly one more card. If you receive two cards with equal ranks, you can split them. You must make a second bet of equal value, before receiving two additional cards (one for each of the original cards). The two sets of cards are now treated as separate hands. You can hit or stand (or double-down or split) individually.

Cards are valued by their rank. Two through Nine are worth just that, regardless of suit. Face cards (i.e., Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points. Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable the player.
